When I entered the tech industry, it felt natural that I would gravitate towards the idea of blogging.  Many of my early articles were contributions for my company’s website.  Company blogs are a great platform to write on.  I learned to work with other departments (usually marketing since they were the ones in charge of the website) and they were always very grateful to get more content.</p>\n<p>As I moved from company to company, I tried to continue this practice.\nOne of the problems I have run across is, the internet is not really a permanent thing.  Websites get rewritten, articles get lost, companies sometimes remove the blogs of former employees.  </p>\n<p>As a result, many references to my old blogs were suffering from link rot.</p>\n<p>This is not really an uncommon thing.  But I had wish I had preserved the articles I’ve written since they represent past work that I’m proud of.</p>\n<p>So with the help of the <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wayback Machine</a>, I started collecting some of my past articles and putting them into a <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/p4blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n<p>My process for this looked something like:</p>\n<p>1.) Find an old URL and look for it in the Wayback Machine<br>\n2.) Save a PDF or PNG using a <a href=\"https://gofullpage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chrome extension</a><br>\n3.) Commit to GitHub repo     </p>\n<p>Having a catalog in GitHub works pretty well since I can browse the articles pretty easily and previewing PDF’s and PNG’s are not a problem.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/abbab/p4blog.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.33165829145729%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/01472/p4blog.webp 240w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/222bd/p4blog.webp 480w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/620b9/p4blog.webp 960w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/fbde0/p4blog.webp 995w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/0783d/p4blog.png 240w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/782f4/p4blog.png 480w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/f570d/p4blog.png 960w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/abbab/p4blog.png 995w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/png\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/f570d/p4blog.png\"\n          alt=\"Blog in GitHub\"\n          title=\"Blog in GitHub\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>They feel just as relevant as any side coding project I’ve ever done.</p>\n<p>I also started collecting other articles I’ve written for other websites and made a <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/miscblogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">repo</a> for those.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you have blogs on other platforms and websites that are not your own, it’s a good idea to keep record of it.  I was only able to recover a fraction of what I’ve written in the past from the Wayback Machine, but that is a good place to start.  I would also recommend putting current blogs in a repo as a backup.  So catalog your blogs!  Give your future self a chance to take a peek back into the past and remember all the great things you wrote.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/catalog-your-blogs","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-16","description":"Why you should catalog your blogs.","tags":null,"title":"Catalog Your Blogs","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/catalog-your-blogs"}}}
