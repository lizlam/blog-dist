It’s uncomfortable. It’s scary. It makes people uneasy trudging toward the unknown. But when I found myself at a fork in the road of my career, it became clear to me. I must change. Industries don’t stay static and neither should people.</p>\n<p>I am no stranger to the software industry. I’ve worked at large corporations and mid-sized companies. I’ve built a comfortable career at fairly successful companies and have learned a great deal from working on interesting projects. I spent 12 years at my last company and though it was going fine, there was a little voice inside of me that kept reminding me to not get too comfortable.</p>\n<p>When I received my opportunity to work at SKUR, I was ecstatic. I always wanted to work for a startup and loved the idea of being able to contribute to a company at the ground level. The first two weeks was a whirlwind of a lot of new information. This is true both on the technology front and domain front. I learned about AWS EC2 instances, S3 buckets and CodePipelines. I went over the architecture of a LAMP stack application, read Python code, committed changes to the website and gave UX input. I learned that many scans make up a point cloud and that all scans default to meters. These may just be many strange words for some, for me they represent a breaking out of my former comfort and the beginning of a journey with the exciting company that SKUR is.</p>\n<p>I’ve been told the construction world is one of the slowest industries to adopt technology and companies are just starting to explore innovations that will push them to the next level. I am excited to help contribute towards that goal and excited to walk along that same path.</p>\n<p><em>This blog was <a href=\"https://skur.com/2018/06/19/starting-first-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">originally posted</a> on the SKUR corporate site.</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts//posts/starting-first-startup","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-06-19","description":"No one likes change.","tags":null,"title":"Starting at My First Startup","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts//posts/starting-first-startup"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301","63107425"]}
