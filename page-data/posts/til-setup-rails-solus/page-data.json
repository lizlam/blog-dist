I’ve been running the <a href=\"https://solus-project.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Solus distribution</a> for a couple of months now.  I wanted to move over some of my local development environments from my Fedora laptop.  This is a little bit of a challenge if you’re used to mainstream Linux distributions (mainstream Linux seems like a bit of a oxymoron) with familiar tools such as apt or yum.  Solus is pretty new and not forked from another distro.  It has its own packaging system called ‘eopkg’.  These are the steps I had to take to get a Rails environment up and running and deployed using Heroku.</p>\n<p>First I had to install all the packages needed to get Rails up and running:   </p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sudo eopkg install -c system.devel</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sudo eopkg install ruby-devel</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sudo eopkg install sqlite3-devel</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sudo eopkg install nodejs</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sudo gem install rails</code>   </p>\n<p>Since I was using postgres, I also had to run the following:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sudo eopkg install postgresql</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sudo eokpkg install postgresql-devel</code></p>\n<p>All that’s left is to download and install the Heroku command line client:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">wget https://cli-assets.heroku.com/branches/stable/heroku-linux-amd64.tar.gz -O heroku.tar.gz</code>    </p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">tar zxvf heroku.tar.gz</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">cd heroku</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sudo install</code>    </p>\n<p>After the Heroku client finished installing, I was able to clone my Rails projects and get them up and running.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/til-setup-rails-solus","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-05-12","description":"Today I learned how to set up a Rails development environment on Solus.","tags":null,"title":"Today I Learned How to Setup a Rails Environment on Solus","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/til-setup-rails-solus"}}}
