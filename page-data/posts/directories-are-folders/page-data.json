She is a junior from one of our local high schools and had an interest in getting some hands-on Perforce exposure. I only had an hour so I kept my goals simple. I wanted to teach her how to create her very first “Hello World” shell script, check it into the depot, make edits, and view revision history with some of our tools.</p>\n<p>The first thing I asked her to do was to open a terminal window and navigate to a certain directory using the cd command. With a puzzled look, she asked,</p>\n<p>“What’s a directory?”</p>\n<p>“A directory is where your files reside.”</p>\n<p>She still looked puzzled.</p>\n<p>“It’s basically a folder. Do you know what a folder is?”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes, I know what a folder is!”</p>\n<p>I can’t tell you how surreal this moment was for me. I was her age when Windows 95 came out. I recall creating folders in the GUI and opening DOS prompts to check that a directory had actually been created. I knew what directories were, but folders I was suspicious of. This went on for some time before I finally trusted that creating folders did indeed make directories. I take this knowledge for granted and then realized that many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CLI</a> commands won’t make sense unless you know what a directory is.</p>\n<p>Next step was to show her how to use VI to create and edit her first HelloWorld.sh. I was surprised and proud that she was able to maneuver around in VI fairly easily. Using <a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-client\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">P4V</a>, she marked the shell script for add and submitted the file to one of our test depots. I showed her how to view revision history using [Revision Graph](Revision Graph), <a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/support/tutorial-video-library/video/using-time-lapse-view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Time-lapse View</a> and <a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">P4Merge</a>. She was particularly interested in seeing diffs with P4Merge referring to it as “cool.” Which I consider a big win coming from a teenager! Finally, I showed her how to execute the same steps using our p4 command line client.</p>\n<p>Our hour was up and I was happy to cover what we did. I’m constantly amazed by the learning experiences I have by working at Perforce. I initially set out to teach our intern about Perforce. She ended up giving me insights about the software and technology experience for a teenager in 2012. And trust me, they’re not checking what happens after a folder gets created.</p>\n<p><em>This is article was <a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/blog/120821/directories-are-folders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">originally published</a> on the Perforce Corporate Blog.</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts//posts/directories-are-folders","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-08-21","description":"I recently had the opportunity to spend some time with our Girls Inc. marketing intern.","tags":null,"title":"Directories are Folders","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts//posts/directories-are-folders"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301","63107425"]}
