I initially felt a bit nervous about it because although I have been to many conferences, meetups and seminars, I have actually never done a talk before.    </p>\n<p>After some thought, I decided to make the talk a workshop in order to increase the interactivity.  Knowing it would be a relatively small group, this made more sense to me.  The workshop was meant to be a gentle introduction to the git command-line with the hope of empowering the QA group with knowledge of our git usage.  The workshop lasted about an hour and by the end the audience became familiar with the following:    </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new git repositories</li>\n<li>Add and commit files to a repo</li>\n<li>Create and merge branches</li>\n<li>Clone repositories</li>\n<li>Fetch and pull changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the talk the QA team thanked me and even asked for a part 2! This ended up being a great exercise, not only because it is a good way to spread knowledge to other coworkers, but it also helped me learn how to articulate some of my own knowledge.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a similar introduction to git or want to give a similar workshop at your company, feel free to grab my <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/talks/blob/master/git-basics-by-grepliz.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">slides</a> and let me know how it goes.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/first-git-talk","tagSlugs":["/tag/command-line/","/tag/training/","/tag/learning/","/tag/talks/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-08","description":"A gentle introduction to the git command-line.","tags":["command line","training","learning","talks"],"title":"Giving My First Talk on Git","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/first-git-talk"}}}
