When I entered the tech industry, it felt natural that I would gravitate towards the idea of blogging.  Many of my early articles were contributions for my company’s website.  Company blogs are a great platform to write on.  I learned to work with other departments (usually marketing since they were the ones in charge of the website) and they were always very grateful to get more content.</p>\n<p>As I moved from company to company, I tried to continue this practice.\nOne of the problems I have run across is, the internet is not really a permanent thing.  Websites get rewritten, articles get lost, companies sometimes remove the blogs of former employees.  </p>\n<p>As a result, many references to my old blogs were suffering from link rot.</p>\n<p>This is not really an uncommon thing.  But I had wish I had preserved the articles I’ve written since they represent past work that I’m proud of.</p>\n<p>So with the help of the <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wayback Machine</a>, I started collecting some of my past articles and putting them into a <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/p4blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n<p>My process for this looked something like:</p>\n<p>1.) Find an old URL and look for it in the Wayback Machine<br>\n2.) Save a PDF or PNG using a <a href=\"https://gofullpage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chrome extension</a><br>\n3.) Commit to GitHub repo     </p>\n<p>Having a catalog in GitHub works pretty well since I can browse the articles pretty easily and previewing PDF’s and PNG’s are not a problem.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 960px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/4cdf7/p4blog.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/8ac56/p4blog.webp 240w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/d3be9/p4blog.webp 480w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/e46b2/p4blog.webp 960w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/157c9/p4blog.webp 995w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/8ff5a/p4blog.png 240w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/e85cb/p4blog.png 480w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/d9199/p4blog.png 960w,\n/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/4cdf7/p4blog.png 995w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/0e9ed499a3f9d9b57d52a07ca5d230fc/d9199/p4blog.png\"\n            alt=\"Blog in GitHub\"\n            title=\"Blog in GitHub\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>They feel just as relevant as any side coding project I’ve ever done.</p>\n<p>I also started collecting other articles I’ve written for other websites and made a <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/miscblogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">repo</a> for those.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you have blogs on other platforms and websites that are not your own, it’s a good idea to keep record of it.  I was only able to recover a fraction of what I’ve written in the past from the Wayback Machine, but that is a good place to start.  I would also recommend putting current blogs in a repo as a backup.  So catalog your blogs!  Give your future self a chance to take a peek back into the past and remember all the great things you wrote.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/catalog-your-blogs","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-16","description":"Why you should catalog your blogs.","tags":null,"title":"Catalog Your Blogs","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/catalog-your-blogs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","914177244"]}
