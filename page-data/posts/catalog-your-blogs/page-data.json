When I entered the tech industry, it felt natural that I would gravitate towards the idea of blogging.  Many of my early articles were contributions for my company’s website.  Company blogs are a great platform to write on.  I learned to work with other departments (usually marketing since they were the ones in charge of the website) and they were always very grateful to get more content.</p>\n<p>As I moved from company to company, I tried to continue this practice.\nOne of the problems I have run across is, the internet is not really a permanent thing.  Websites get rewritten, articles get lost, companies sometimes remove the blogs of former employees.</p>\n<p>As a result, many references to my old blogs were suffering from link rot.</p>\n<p>This is not really an uncommon thing.  But I had wish I had preserved the articles I’ve written since they represent past work that I’m proud of.</p>\n<p>So with the help of the <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wayback Machine</a>, I started collecting some of my past articles and putting them into a <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/p4blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n<p>My process for this looked something like:</p>\n<p>1.) Find an old URL and look for it in the Wayback Machine<br>\n2.) Save a PDF or PNG using a <a href=\"https://gofullpage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chrome extension</a><br>\n3.) Commit to GitHub repo</p>\n<p>Having a catalog in GitHub works pretty well since I can browse the articles pretty easily and previewing PDF’s and PNG’s are not a problem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/p4blog.png\" alt=\"Blog in GitHub\"></p>\n<p>They feel just as relevant as any side coding project I’ve ever done.</p>\n<p>I also started collecting other articles I’ve written for other websites and made a <a href=\"https://github.com/lizlam/miscblogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">repo</a> for those.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you have blogs on other platforms and websites that are not your own, it’s a good idea to keep record of it.  I was only able to recover a fraction of what I’ve written in the past from the Wayback Machine, but that is a good place to start.  I would also recommend putting current blogs in a repo as a backup.  So catalog your blogs!  Give your future self a chance to take a peek back into the past and remember all the great things you wrote.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts//posts/catalog-your-blogs","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-16","description":"Why you should catalog your blogs.","tags":null,"title":"Catalog Your Blogs","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts//posts/catalog-your-blogs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301","63107425"]}
