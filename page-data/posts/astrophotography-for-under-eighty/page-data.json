As a child, it was one of my many simple pleasures.\nThe night sky has often been my companion in times of reflection and solitude.  Being able to\ncapture glimpses of these moments is a hobby I always wanted to explore.  So it was with great\nenthusiasm that I researched how to get into astrophotography.  As far as I could tell, I just needed\na few things: a telescope, a camera and a way to attach the two.</p>\n<p>Purchasing a telescope for the first time can be a really intimidating thing.  I wasn’t ready\nto spend thousands of dollars on one, but I didn’t want to buy a toy either.  Then I saw a reference\nto the Galileoscope in a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/828758431/messier-observers-planisphere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Kickstarter project</a> I was perusing.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.galileoscope.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Galileoscope</a> is a telescope kit you can put together.  It’s basically an educational device\nto learn about optics and you end up with a no frills telescope similar to the one Galileo used.  Many retailers sell the kit for\nabout $50, but after some quick research, I figured out that I could buy them directly from <a href=\"http://www.galileoscope.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.galileoscope.org</a> for $25 each.\nThe catch was you needed to purchase a box of 6.  Well, I didn’t need 6 telescopes, so I sent an email out\nto a group of friends in attempt to get 5 other people in on a bulk purchase.  It didn’t take long to get 5 takers and within\na week I had a box of 6 Galileoscopes in my house.</p>\n<p>Telescope  ✔<br>\nCost: $25 + $5 Shipping &#x26; Handling.</p>\n<p>The Galileoscope needs a standard camera tripod to be mounted on.  I didn’t have one lying around but was able to\npurchase one on Amazon for a relatively cheap price.  I have Amazon Prime, so shipping was free (sort of).</p>\n<p>Tripod  ✔<br>\nCost: $25</p>\n<p>Trying to purchase a camera is just as intimidating as trying to purchase a telescope.  Should I get a point and shoot? Should I get an SLR?<br>\nThen it dawned on me that if I can use my phone camera, I wouldn’t have to worry about the choice.  Now don’t scoff, I have a Motorola Droid\nMini with a 12 megapixel camera, and although it can’t compete with an SLR - it definitely can hold its on.  So what I really needed was an\nadapter to attach my phone to the telescope.  Again with some help from Amazon, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013D2ULO6?keywords=telescope%20phone%20adpater&#x26;qid=1445416268&#x26;ref_=sr_1_sc_1&#x26;sr=8-1-spell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I found an adapter</a> that I thought would do the trick.</p>\n<p>Phone adapter for telescope  ✔<br>\nCost:  $25</p>\n<p>Putting it all together is a little tricky.  You need to make sure the focuser tube is tight on the Galileoscope because the weight of the adapter and phone can cause it to slide.  The phone camera needs to be aligned up with the eyepiece and focusing the telescope with it attached requires a bit\nof patience.  But overall I was quite pleased with the results.</p>\n<p>Here’s a photo of the moon:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/moon.jpg\" alt=\"moon\"></p>\n<p>This was a great introductory setup and for less than $80, a worthy route into the world of astrophotography.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts//posts/astrophotography-for-under-eighty","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-10-20","description":"I've always loved looking up at the stars.","tags":null,"title":"Astrophotography For Under $80","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts//posts/astrophotography-for-under-eighty"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301"]}
