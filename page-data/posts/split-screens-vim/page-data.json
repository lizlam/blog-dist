Perhaps you want to make some comparison with a chunk at the top of file with something in the middle.  With a few keystrokes you can do exactly that.</p>\n<p>##Split Horizontally</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/vim-split-screen-h.gif\" alt=\"Horizontal Screen Split\"></p>\n<p>To split the screen horizontally:\na.) Hit <code class=\"language-text\">CTRL</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>\nb.) and then <code class=\"language-text\">s</code>.</p>\n<p>If you want to navigate between the screen:\na.) Hit <code class=\"language-text\">CTRL</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>\nb.) and then <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>.</p>\n<p>To exit out of one of the screen:\na.)

Start by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">CTRL</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>\nb.) but then hit <code class=\"language-text\">v</code> (instead of <code class=\"language-text\">s</code>).</p>\n<p>Navigating between the split screens is the same (<code class=\"language-text\">CTRL</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">w</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>).</p>\n<p>Though horizontal splitting works great.  I find vertical splitting to be the most useful.</p>\n<p>##Combine Both</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/vim-split-screen-b.gif\" alt=\"Vertical and Horizontal Screen Split\"></p>\n<p>Why choose?  It is possible to combine both horizontal and vertical screen splitting as well.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts//posts/split-screens-vim","tagSlugs":["/tag/vi/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-10-14","description":"Have you ever found yourself going through a long file in `vim` and wishing you could split your screen? tags: vim,","tags":["vi"],"title":"How to Split Screens in vim","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts//posts/split-screens-vim"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301"]}
