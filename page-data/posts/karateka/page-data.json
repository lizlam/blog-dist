These journals tell his story in a unique and genuine way.  At just 17, he is pushing himself to get into the video game industry by writing computer games on his Apple II.</p>\n<p>I really loved this book.  It was a great insight into the programming culture of the early 1980’s and what the video game landscape looked like.  I have met so many people who got into programming because of video games and it is interesting to see how that played out for Mechner.</p>\n<p>I never played Karateka but I was a big Prince of Persia fan which prompted me to pick up both this book and its sequel, <a href=\"https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/books/journals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Making of Prince of Persia</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>The Making of Karateka</em> is definitely a great read and inspiring.  There were so many things that impressed me.  I loved how even at a young age, Mechner was focused on chasing after his dream of creating a great game.  That he was able to focus on it for as long as he did.  That he didn’t flunk all his classes!  That a 17 year old would even commit to writing journals like this.</p>\n<p>It gave me a lot to think about.</p>\n<p>As all good books do.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts//posts/karateka","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2023-06-24","description":"Quick thoughts on The Making of Karateka by Jordan Mechner.","tags":null,"title":"Thoughts on The Making of Karateka","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts//posts/karateka"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2764776372","401334301"]}
